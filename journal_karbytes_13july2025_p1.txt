It occurred to me today that the most accurate description of what I mean by "purple" and "green" in the following article is "pertaining to the status of my living human body" and "pertaining to the fundamental nature of existence beyond personal identification" respectively: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/green_and_purple_definitions/

It seems that the goal of karbytes (besides implicitly investing physical resources into the maintenance and expansion of karbytes' curated knowledge structures (manifest both as digitized and public web-hosted intellectual property and as the literal mind of the singular author of that intellectual property)) is to increase the ratio of "green" content to "purple" content within karbytes' curated knowledge structures as time elapses forward in karbytes' lifespan (without karbytes completely ceasing to generate any "purple" content (due to the fact that "purple" content enables artistic expression and hence a means for attaining a particular type of comfort which would not be available to karbytes if karbytes exclusively generated "green" content (though that claim may be refuted by karbytes after karbytes decides that it has no further cravings for generating "purple" content in the karbytes archive nor possibly even elsewhere))).

If it seems that karbytes is denigrating "purple" that is because karbytes is aware that having a self and maintaining it (especially post childhood) is a luxury few people are genuinely willing to support economically. In other words, karbytes understands that, once a human becomes an adult, its encompassing society does not want that adult to receive provisions without paying for them in some manner which other people find sufficiently useful and hence worthy of economic compensation. (Adults who refuse to "earn their keep" or who are prevented from doing so by systemic barriers or by personal handicaps are often relegated to being on an income far below average which subtly comminates that such people are not worthy of enjoying as much freedom and comfort as most other society members are).

It seems that many people find karbytes to be deserving of punishment, torture, and deprivation of funds (including the means to obtain and keep employment or other income sources) due to the fact that those people think that karbytes has been enjoying too many valuable experiences or commodities for free (i.e. without making requisite sacrifices to be worthy of such niceties). Hence, practically zero people (as of 13_JULY_2025) have ever donated money to karbytes via the PayPal donation portal on the home page of karbytes' two websites (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com). Furthermore, as karbytes has become more prolific and established as a personal brand on the Internet (and public figure instead of someone who is more private like what is deemed to be normal for a typical "working class" member of society), employers karbytes had set up job interviews with had been (more frequently than before) passive aggressively failing to show up to the scheduled job interviews and following up as promised on job applications (which lead karbytes to assume that karbytes is subtly being discouraged by society from "showing off" its personal brand and, instead, encouraged to exude a more humble and "neurotypical" demeanor which is conducive to socially meshing well with "diverse" populations (or worse: being coerced into showing diminished self-esteem and a lower degree of self-control and other "attractive" qualities so as to make karbytes not a threatening piece of competition for other job hunters who are more likely to conform to societal conventions (which is conducive to impregnating more women and lowering their education levels (which is conducive to keeping the population of a nation relatively large and aligned with a common sense of purpose and standards of conduct)))).

(karbyte half-joking told itself that a person cannot simultaneously be a "social justice warrior" (especially a "feminist") at the same time that person attempts to live as though it is not part of the marginalized class that person is openly advocating for as a "social justice warrior"). Hence, if karbytes does not want to be treated as a target of discrimination by society, karbytes presumably must avoid calling attention to its perception or experiences of being discriminated against by society. Otherwise, karbytes would get flagged for being "too unhappy" with the status quo to be "worthy" of being offered a job which supports the status quo because otherwise would mean karbytes could be hired as a "Trojan horse" which sneaks disruptive ideologies and influences into the otherwise hermetically sealed company culture and cause systemic destabilization. Or, to be more "humble" and "down-to-earth", the prospective employer might say, "We are not hiring you to help you further your personal ideology nor build your personal brand of lifestyle. Instead, we are hiring you to promote our business and to represent it in all that you do whether on the clock or off." For now on, karbytes will try to exude more of a "nobody" persona who is neither happy nor miserable yet hardworking, humble, and easy-going (within what is commonly or typically agreed to be "reasonable bounds"). In short, karbytes will probably pretend not to notice the weird antics in its environment and be more of a listener than a speaker in conversations (but not be shy to speak up when the job requires it)).

karbytes figures that it is "purple" to discuss its employment-related, financial-related, interpersonal-relationships-related, and even health-related concerns and experiences on karbytes' public media outlets and a more dignified path for karbytes is to restrict what karbytes publishes via those media outlets mostly (if not entirely) "green" contents (and only publishing "purple" content on those channels if such "purple" content is not explicitly autobiographical nor direct gossip about some other person) starting immediately after karbytes2025_18 is finalized. (Any "purple" content which karbytes publishes in versions of karbytes which emerge after karbytes2025_18 is finalized will most likely pertain to philosophical explorations and postulations, experimental interactions with artificial intelligence (especially in the generation of artwork such as images, videos, and sound files), and artwork created by karbytes without the aid of artificial intelligence. Most content which karbytes expects to publish following the finalization of karbytes2025_18 are software engineering tutorials like what is showcased in the following web page: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/software_engineering_portfolio/).
