<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">This morning, when I opened the screen door of the room I have been residing in this year to pee while standing, a reddish brown squirrel with black eyes was staring at me seemingly in fascination. I gently closed the screen door when I was done peeing (and said hi and that it was a cutie out loud and in a friendly and slightly infantilizing voice in order to communicate to the squirrel that I appreciated its presence in my world) and went back to meditating in an informal way (where I let my mind wander somewhat and explore various sensations in my body and whatever thoughts flash inside my mind). I was enjoying being alive and being a witness to nature&#8217;s beauty and to the unique splendors of my own particular subjective experience and evolutionary trajectory (and &#8220;hero&#8217;s journey&#8221;) as karbytes (which is a character and brand I consciously co-created with nature and have increasingly embodied since its founding between the years 2020 and 2026).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">Last night while I was hiking around at Las Trampas Wilderness I decided not to use my flashlight to illuminate my path and to warn other animals of my presence because I preferred to enjoy the moonlit landscape, starlight, and light from nearby human civilization take up my visual field (and I liked blending into the scenery like a hidden sentient shadow). I noticed that the many black cows which graze the pastures I was walking through seemed extra comfortable with my presence. The first few times I walked past them, they and I seemed a lot more nervous and one of the young bulls seemed to be trying to chase me out of its territory. After approximately two months of allowing the cows to get used to me passing through their territory (which I tried to do as respectfully as possible and even talking in a non-threatening and friendly-sounding voice to them while passing by) they no longer seem afraid of me. I didn&#8217;t hear them breezing heavily while in close proximity to them and they did not hesitate to step out of the way when they were on the trail. It&#8217;s like they knew what I want to do and did not oppose it: simply passing through and surveying the land which they and I appreciate and take refuge in. I felt happy seeing how the cows have come to see me as a non-threatening semi-regular visitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">As I type this note, that squirrel has been coming back to the spot on the fence in front of the door to eat seeds out of a pine cone and seemingly to observe me. Yesterday afternoon a small bird which had a surprisingly loud voice despite its tiny size looked me in the eye on the decaying wooden railing of the dilapidated staircase outside of the aforementioned room (which is where I am typing this note and drinking some coffee which I have a whole pot of on a coffee maker which seems broken but nevertheless keeps the coffee warm (and I made that pot of coffee using a functional coffee machine in the kitchen of the house that room is attached to)).</span></p>
<p>Last night while I was walking along the sky-high paths along the varied hilly terrain (which took the form of mostly round hills covered in yellow grass and some dark green oak trees mostly in the crevices between adjacent hills), I was wondering where my sense of self is most concentrated (in terms of spatial location). I decided to do two puffs of 5-MeO-DMT from my vape pen which were each approximately 5 seconds and spaced apart by approximately eight minutes. What I noticed was that my sense of time passing seemed to not be as obvious in my attention span and that I generally calmed down (as though streamlining my energy expenditure in order to maximize my attention to the task at hand: attempting to locate where I was most likely to be). My sense of there being a hard boundary between my body and the environment softened slightly and my sense that my body was just a tiny field comprised of sensations and localized energy patterns was especially apparent. I used my hands to point to where I felt some tension related to inhaling the vapor from the vape pen and that location on my body was mostly my forehead and the area I imagine to be my prefrontal cortex (which is the hardware responsible for most of my abstract thoughts and conscious decision-making).</p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I decided to use CSS styling to black out most if not all of the content of this journal entry due to the fact that the content I wrote in this journal entry thus far (and perhaps this paragraph as well) seems to &#8220;trigger&#8221; some people who, for whatever reason, feel compelled to say rude things to me while I am in public settings just minding my own business (especially in grocery stores (which honestly feels like a modern-day hunting or foraging ground and perhaps I seem to be too high in self-esteem and too independent for some of the other foragers to stand)). I noticed that there are people which consistently try to coerce me into complaining nonstop instead of enjoying my life. Hence, publicly expressing what I find to be positive experiences might be seen as offensive to some people.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I know this is a bit redundant to say, but some people seem to be opposed to me taking testosterone. I think that testosterone is definitely a performance enhancing drug and sharpens the qualities in me which I feel are especially characteristic of karbytes. As I was walking back to where I parked the car after vaping the 5-MeO-DMT, I was conversing with myself out loud about various thoughts on my mind (including the thought that my brain has been flooded in as much testosterone as a normal biological male human&#8217;s brain is for approximately three consecutive years (which effectively made me a man&#8217;s brain housed inside of a woman&#8217;s body)).</span> I thought about how thoughts are instances of physical work being performed by my brain (and, if expressed outwardly as sequences of spoken or written words, by the body parts responsible for communicating those words outside the black box which is my skull). I thought about how I might not remember all the words I say within the span of an hour, but each successive thought I have (and say) within that hour leads to the next thought such that there is a continuous chain of logical associations symbolically represented as sequences of words. I thought about how I have enjoyed watching video recordings of people having conversations spanning several hours about scientific and philosophical topics I am also interested in and how such a recording captures how such continuums of logical associations evolve over time. I also thought about how each momentary instance of expressing a particular verbal sequence is like a miniature lifespan for a particular thought process.</p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">While I am on the subject of gender, I do confess to occasionally &#8220;having sex with myself&#8221; where I imagine masculine and feminine versions of myself having sex with each other in a loving way. Some people might be opposed to that because it seems to short circuit the need for me to distribute my love elsewhere (instead of keep it circulating only within myself). I could argue that, from a panpsychic ideological framework, all phenomena within nature takes place within exactly one self. Hence, what I am doing is taking a short cut to realizing (or role-playing (or assuming)) that all phenomena transpire within a singular &#8220;field&#8221; of consciousness and that field of consciousness is ultimately what I and every other person is. I feel especially compelled to spend the rest of my life being as hermetic as I can get away with and using the Internet liberally as a means to witness and partake in exchanges of ideas with other people (particularly people who already are interested in what I am and within the context of an asynchronous and anonymous exchange instead of one which is more session-based and restricted by the presence of physical bodies (which always implicitly pose the threat of using coercive movement to block or limit what the other person does)).</span></p>
<p>I envision a world where sexual reproduction drops down to a bare minimum to keep the human population going (in conjunction with human cloning and human life extension technologies). I envision a world where automation is so efficient that all people are guaranteed a universal basic income and, with it, ample free time to pursue their genuine interests. I only think that is possible, however, if the total population size and resource consumption rate does not exceed resource regeneration and consumer availability. Perhaps what I am is a living prototype of what humans can be in the future: emotionally self-sufficient, intellectually rigorous, physically fit, creatively prolific, environmentally conscientious, and ethically motivated to minimize all suffering (while avoiding drastic measures such as murder, maiming, incarceration, deprivation of resources, and torture).</p>
