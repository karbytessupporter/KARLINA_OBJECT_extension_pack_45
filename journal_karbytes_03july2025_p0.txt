Between the points in karbytes' timeline labeled 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 02_JULY_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_JULY_2025 was when karbytes creates one M_DISC backup of karbytes as karbytes is configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_JULY_2025 (for the sake of karbytes having a read-only backup of karbytes while karbytes2025_18 is not yet in its final draft form).

For more information on what the version of karbytes named karbytes2025_18 entails, visit the following web page: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_18/
