This morning I had a dream which was very detailed and eventful. I think the dream might have been brought on by the fact that I did some microdoses of psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT yesterday while hiking around in a beautiful wilderness area. Events in that dream seemed to have occurred in a chronological order. The first event of significance I remember was talking on the phone with some anonymous person who seemed to be one of the voices which communicates with me non-stop in my waking life since early 2019 via some kind of brain-to-computer interface (and I am pretty sure that such a phenomenon is implemented by people who work for the government (though I still am not entirely sure why such a phenomenon has been occurring (and my guess is that it is to prevent me from wasting my mind and instead making it so that I can be effective at serving society somehow))). Anyway, in the dream I was walking along some corridor of some giant house where other people I knew as friends and family were also staying at (and it had the feel of a vacation home but seemed to take place in what my mental map conceives of as being slightly to the north of the intersection of Redwood Road and Proctor Road near my legal residence in Castro Valley, California. (In "real life" (i.e. my waking life) I often subtly visualize specific physical locations while thinking about other things when I am not physically traveling and devoting most of my attention to maneuvering through space. When I am physically stationary in "real life" I almost always seem to have some randomly selected location I have been to several times playing in the background such that the space seems static and devoid of inhabitants. The same phenomenon seemed to have been happening in my dream while I was talking on the phone with the anonymous person but, due to the fact that I was dreaming, the boundaries between what my mind was visualizing as a physical place in the background of me conversing with the anonymous person seemed blurred such that the house I was in seemed to be physically located "above" that region I mentioned near the intersection of Proctor Road and Redwood Road such that the house seemed to be many stories high or else was weirdly superimposed into whatever else would otherwise be there in "real life")). The man on the phone was telling me some clues about why I was involved in technological telepathy (though I do not remember what exactly he said other than him telling me to wait twenty minutes for him to call me back while he set up some kind of configuration). I ended up talking to some other people in the house and some events seemed to happen which I don't remember which sounded like getting to know whoever those random people were which somehow seemed to be friends of mine which I recently met and was staying at the house of. I remember walking into one of the bedrooms of the guys who lived there who had his girlfriend over and both of them were laying in an embrace on his bed which had clear walls around it with opaque cutouts of pro wrestlers on them and such that the bed looked like a boxing ring. I think I saw the bed as a boxing ring appear first before I saw the couple appear on the bed. At the foot of the bed in that relatively small, dark, and cluttered room was a large wall-mounted television playing some noisy sports game. There was an orange striped cat sitting on the bed closest to the door where I was standing and the cat was holding onto some kind of blue plushie. I think there was some guy with me which felt like the person I knew the best there and who might have been the one to invite me over. Behind us there was some other guy talking (or else it was the guy on the bed) talking because some other guy (presumably the slightly younger brother or one of his friends) going into the room and climbing onto the bed to lie at the foot of it. The guy who seemed to own that room said something like, "What are you doing in my bed, bro?" I was just watching in amusement at the antics and then saw the cat calmly get up and exit the room past me. I turned and saw some black guy with dreadlocks lying on the floor on his back seemingly in order to eavesdrop on what was going on in that room while he was pretending to be asleep. Apparently everyone thought that was a very action-packed room! I walked with my friend (who I don't know what looked like but could hear and sense as a tangible presence to the side of my body) along that downstairs corridor towards other bedrooms along that corridor and I was noticing that each of the bedrooms (for the "kids" of that very wealthy household) had gigantic rooms which looked like houses unto themselves (and that dark room with the wrestling ring themed bed seemed to have its own bathroom and other compartments deeper into the room). One of the rooms looked like a gigantic princess suite with pink and white trimming. The room my friend and I walked into was one we both seemed especially intrigued by. It had its own staircase loft inside of it with an elaborate professional drum kit on it and another drum kit like it on the floor level of that room. We walked up the stairs to see it and then noticed to the right that the loft had expanded to include a grand piano near the wall and a single snare drum next of it (which I thought was there to serve as a metronome for whoever is playing the piano). I could not help but notice that the furniture looked exactly like the 1960s themed "modern" style chairs in my dad's house (which is my legal residence and my dad also has a drum kit sitting in the middle of the living room of that house). I think I saw glimpses of the face of the guy who lived in that room though he was not physically present at that point in the dream (though I vaguely rememebered getting to know him while hanging out with the people in that house at some prior point in time such as going to an amusement park together). I saw the guy's face randomly appear in some lavender plants which randomly appeared in that room and, for whatever reason, I was very obsessed with trying to uncover the mystery of that room and was trying to point out what I was noticing to my friend who did not seem as interested because he wanted to continue on touring other rooms of the house and I felt compelled to go with him as though we were conjoined twins. I woke up at nearly 3PM Pacific Standard Time and spent some time listening to the conversations occuring in my brain and seemingly with brains external to mine before getting up to get some bread and coffee and then opening my laptop to browse Reddit before mustering up the "oomph" to working on my blog-related projects such as this dream journal and the app I have been meaning to get around to completing which generates animations of fractals.
