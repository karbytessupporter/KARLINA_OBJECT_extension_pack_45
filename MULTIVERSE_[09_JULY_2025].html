<p><strong>UNIVERSE:</strong> exactly one unique <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spacetime</a> continuum which contains <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy</a> (and possibly <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">matter</a>) arranged in a particular configuration.</p>
<p>Zero, some <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural number</a>, or infinitely many unique <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agents</a> inhabit any particular universe (and such information processing agents can possibly inhabit the same encompassing universe simultaneously or asynchronously).</p>
<p>The lifespan of any particular universe is either finite in duration or else infinitely long in temporal duration. A universe whose lifespan is infinitely long in duration is either a cyclical non-terminating universe or else a non-repeating non-terminating universe.</p> 
<p>In a <strong>cyclical non-terminating universe</strong>, all of the matter and energy patterns, X, which occur inside of a particular finite time interval whose length is T arbitrarily atomic units of time (within that universe&#8217;s overall timeline) verbatim recur each time T seconds elapses immediately after X most recently transpired within that universe&#8217;s overall spacetime continuum. In pseudocode that can be represented as follows:</p>
<pre>
// This pseudocode function models a cyclical non-terminating universe's essential logic.
// (Note that i++ adds the same quantity to i universe.total_elapsed_time++ adds to universe.total_elapsed_time).
universe.elapse_time() {
    universe.render(universe.X[i]); // render a temporally atomic subset of X at the current time
    i++; // increment index of array X (such that X is a finite and chronological sequence of phenomena)
    universe.total_elapsed_time++; // elapse time by one arbitrarily atomic unit of time
    if (universe.total_elapsed_time % universe.T == 0) { // universe.T is a fixed and finite length of time
      i = 0; // reset the index of array X to zero (if a T-sized interval has elapsed at current time)
    }
    universe.elapse_time(); // recursively call this function to perpetuate universe's evolution
}
</pre>
<p>In a <strong>non-repeating non-terminating universe</strong>, all of the matter and energy patterns which occur inside of any specific finite time interval (of that universe&#8217;s overall timeline) are not guaranteed to repeat themselves verbatim and in immediate succession throughout that universe&#8217;s evolution. Instead, the emergence of phenomena throughout that universe&#8217;s evolutionary timeline are <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">randomized</a> to some degree. In pseudocode that can be represented as follows:</p>
<pre>
// This pseudocode function models a non-repeating non-terminating universe's essential logic.
// (Note that i++ adds the same quantity to i universe.total_elapsed_time++ adds to universe.total_elapsed_time).
universe.elapse_time() {
    universe.render(universe.X[i]); // render a temporally atomic subset of X at the current time
    i++; // increment index of array X (such that X is an infinitely long and chronological sequence of phenomena)
    universe.total_elapsed_time++; // elapse time by one arbitrarily atomic unit of time
    universe.elapse_time(); // recursively call this function to perpetuate universe's evolution
}

<p><strong>SUBJECTIVITY:</strong> the process an information processing agent implements which results in that information processing agent appearing to itself to be inhabiting its encompassing physical universe through the interface of a virtual model (i.e. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulation</a>) of that information processing agent&#8217;s encompassing physical universe (which is rendered using that information processing agent&#8217;s physical hardware).</p>
<p><em>A physical process is more rudimentary than a virtual phenomenon. That is because all <strong>virtual phenomena</strong> depend on underlying physical processes to exist while <strong>physical processes</strong> can hypothetically occur without any frame of reference observing them.</em></p>
<p>Each information processing agent which exhibits subjectivity only experiences the simulation which that particular information processing agent&#8217;s constituent physical hardware renders. In other words, an information processing agent&#8217;s entire <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge</a> is a solipsistic phenomenon according to that information processing agent&#8217;s own frame of reference.</p>
<p>Note that is possible for there to be multiple (and indefinitely many) layers of virtuality within an information processing agent&#8217;s simulation. In pseudocode that can be represented as follows:</p>
<pre>
agent.render_simulation(information) {
  let i = X(information); // some finite or indefinite permutation of matter and energy transpiring within a finite or indefinite interval of spacetime which the agent observes and which transpires in accordance to function input
  while (i != terminating_condition) { // the simulation gains complexity if i is not an informational state which terminates the simulation process
    agent.render_simulation(i); // at least one more layer of virtuality is incorporated into the current simulation in a recursive manner
  }
}
</pre>

<p><strong>MULTIVERSE:</strong> the hypothetical existence of multiple universes simultaneously or asynchronously.</p>
<p><em>Whether a particular universe or multiverse exists for a finite interval of time or for an indefinitely long period of time, a universe or multiverse&#8217;s existence is an immutable component of nature given that the respective universe or multiverse was not wholly interchangeable with pure nothingness.</em></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">The fact that this sentence is being rendered right now in some frame of reference is sufficient proof that something other than pure nothingness exists throughout all of nature (which means that nature cannot ever be devoid of something which is not wholly interchangeable with pure nothingness).</span></p>
