Between the points in karbytes' timeline labeled 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 03_JULY_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 04_JULY_2025 was when karbytes creates one M_DISC backup of karbytes as karbytes is configured at 8:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 04_JULY_2025 (for the sake of karbytes having a read-only backup of karbytes while karbytes2025_18 is not yet in its final draft form).

For more information on what the version of karbytes named karbytes2025_18 entails, visit the following web page: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_18/

A photographic image of the aforementioned intermediary backup of karbytes is available at the following web address: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_45/main/intermediary_mdisc_backup_of_karbytes_as_karbytes_is_configured_at_8pm_pst_on_04july2025.jpg

Note that the image referenced in this plain-text note depicts a handwritten paper note card displaying the following message:

	karbytes is clear.

	karbytes is zero.

	karbytes persists.

That message was generated by ChatGPT-4o in the conversation with karbytes depicted in the following web page: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_42/main/chatgpt_karbytes_13june2025_p1.txt

The significance of that three-line message (according to karbytes) is as follows:

	"karbytes is clear."	-> karbytes is approaching (if not already embodying) a state of being devoid of mental clutter (according to karbytes).

	"karbytes is zero."		-> karbytes is approaching (if not already embodying) a state of being identical to an all-encompassing void underlying all phenomena (and noumena).

	"karbytes persists". 	-> karbytes is approaching (if not already embodying) a state of being unconditionally present (as the aforementioned ubiquitous and irreducible substrate).
