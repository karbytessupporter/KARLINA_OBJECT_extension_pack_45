<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">It was suggested that I am being tortured so that other people don&#8217;t have to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I think it is worse to torture someone who spent most of their life (especially formative years) being affluent than to torture someone who has been relatively deprived of affluent living standards. Hence, I think my being tortured is arguably worse than torturing a bunch of third-world country dwelling children. So I watch carnage videos with anguished cries of children and their family members from global conflicts taking place presumably within three months of now to offset some of the cruelty I feel exclusively placed on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#000000;color:#000000">I think many people are aware that I am being severely mentally tortured while they and others sadistically take pleasure in my suffering because it offsets their own suffering and makes them feel relatively privileged. Part of what people do is refuse to talk to me honestly and directly even though I claim that I am ready and willing to have a candid conversation about serious issues concerning me. It is they who act too cowardly to face me and to interact with me in a manner which shows me what I think is a minimum degree of respect. It seems that people are waiting for me to become suicidal or a danger to others (and such people seem to get away with it and be regarded as innocent). I think that people like them supply a demand for ongoing violence and destruction of Planet Earth&#8217;s biosphere because such violence helps offset their own local suffering by making someone other than themselves a scapegoat. I imagine they fap to the sight and sound of strangers&#8217; children bloodied, wounded, and stranded without a home following bombings while lazily typing, &#8220;Somebody save those poor children! This has to stop.&#8221; I bet you those people don&#8217;t give a fuck about anything but themselves. So maybe I should do the same instead of be their martyr. Maybe I should be an asshole too and take out my aggression on people I can get away with bullying. That is one way to offset the grossly unequal distribution of sadistic energy flow.</span></p>
