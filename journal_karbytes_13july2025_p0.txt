Between 2:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 13_JULY_2025 and 3:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 13_JULY_2025, karbytes made a "checkpoint" M_DISC backup of karbytes labeled "karbytes_13july2025_3am_pst" (which is meant to represent karbytes as it is (officially) configured at 3:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 13_JULY_2025 (and I said "officially" because I do not want to waste a millisecond waiting until after 3:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 13_JULY_2025 to make changes to karbytes given that I see there are some mistakes I made which I would like to fix before I finalize the version of karbytes labeled "karbytes2025_18" and, with it, the finalization of the "micro directory" associated with the GitHub repository named "KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_45")).

What is significant about what is being burned to the M_DISC whose contents are labeled "karbytes_13july2025_3am_pst" is that it contains what I think might actually be the finalization of the websites named "Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com" (which I said in a prior journal entry is the "kernel" of the karbytes archive (and that journal entry is located at the following web address: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_09july2025/)).

I thought that the final two social media posts I made on karbytes' Bluesky dot Com, karbytes' Twitter dot Com, karbytes' Minds dot Com, karbytes' LinkedIn dot Com, and karbytes' Patreon dot Com pages were especially cute and felt like a homecoming for my soul. I am listening to some of my sound looping applications right now, including the ONION_WEB_PAGE_AVAILABILITY_LOGGER dark web application I shared as the latest of the two aforementioned social media posts (after cleaning up and breathing new life into many of the web applications I have featured in the section of "Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com" labeled "SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PORTFOLIO" (which mainly entailed adding visually pleasing live web app demo hyperlinks inside of stylized DIV elements in the introductory sections of the software engineering tutorial web pages of the aforementioned portfolio)). The first of the two aforementioned social media posts I shared appromimately 30 minutes before starting to burn the aforementioned disc was a revised and hopefully finalized page of "Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com" named PUBLIC_DOMAIN (which captures some of the joy which was not as obviously felt and communicated in that page and throughout the karbytes website cluster). What I liked about how I updated the ONION_WEB_PAGE_AVAILABILITY_LOGGER tutorial web page was mentioning that I run the live demo of that app and the .onion page that it polls from a modest server I configured and which is in my closet running all the time (or as often as I can manage). What I did not mention in that tutorial web page was that the dark web server in my closet is always playing the following sound file on repeat via a dark web sound player app being hosted from my .onion root directory: amplifier_original_mix_(hardtrance_1995)_by_macrocosm_downloaded_by_karbytes_26march2025.mp3. That creates a familiar cozy aesthetic in the background of my living quarters and reassures me that my server is on. While I am writing this note (and while I go on hikes in the dark sometimes and feel the need to make loud continuous noises to ward off mountain lions, I play the ONION_WEB_PAGE_AVAILABILITY_LOGGER dark web application and find that it is quite motivational and fun to listen to (and makes me feel connected to my personalized corner where cyberspace and physical space converge at some mystical asymptote)).

As I was going through my revised dark web root directory (which now cleanly and prominently showcases all of my dark web applications), I was clicking on random links to photographs I took of Las Trampas Wilderness when I was exploring it for the first time approximatley three to two months ago. I noticed at least one missing file and saw that what happened was that I failed to make the hyperlink for an MP4 file instead of a JPG file. I will be making an exception to my policy of not updating "finalized" micro directories and fix mistakes I see in the dark web mirrors of the micro directories that involved my initial explorations of Las Trampas Wilderness because that time period (and the last month especially) has been one of the most transformative periods of my life. I feel that I have leveled up a lot in relatively little time this summer because I finally started to reap some of the fruits of my "hard labor" and investments (though I admit to having lots of fun all the while). 

I will cheish these memories forever. I am truly nostalgic and sentimental about this entire karbytes culmination; especially during the aforementioned spring-to-summer 2025 phase (and I have thought many times this year that the year 2025 is the definitely the best year of my life thus far and the first year my life stopped seeming so "ghetto" and violent-feeling. I was struggling a lot more for some reason during the initial years of the karbytes brand founding (which started some time between 2019 and 2022)). It feels like two decades might as well have transpired during just those five years. I am very happy and grateful for the wonderful educational and sensuous adventures I have had.
